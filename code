Here is the code for quiz 3:

section .text
	
	global _start
_start:
	mov eax, [x]        ;load eax with x = 4 (or whatever number)
	mov ecx, [x]        ;load ecx with x
	sub ecx, 1          ;subtract 1 from ecx to ensure values multiplied descend
	call factorial      ;call factorial procedure
	call exit

factorial:
	mul ecx             ;multiply the current value in eax by ecx
	loop factorial      ;decrement ecx (since ecx is treated as a counter by default)

exit:
	mov eax, 1
    int 0x80


section .data
	x	dd	4
